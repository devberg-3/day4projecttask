<h2 style=text-align:left;color:#191970;font-family:cursive;>Why should you learn Music?</h2>
<h3>1. Musical training helps develop language and reasoning:</h3>
 
<p>Students who have early musical training will develop the areas of the brain related to language and reasoning. The left side of the brain is better developed with music, and songs can help imprint information on young minds.</p>

<h3>2. A mastery of memorization:</h3>
<p>Even when performing with sheet music, student musicians are constantly using their memory to perform. The skill of memorization can serve students well in education and beyond.</p>

<h3>3. Students learn to improve their work:</h3><p>Learning music promotes craftsmanship, and students learn to want to create good work instead of mediocre work. This desire can be applied to all subjects of study.</p>

<h3>4. Increased coordination:</h3><p>Students who practice with musical instruments can improve their hand-eye coordination. Just like playing sports, children can develop motor skills when playing music.</p>

<h3>5. A sense of achievement:</h3><p>Learning to play pieces of music on a new instrument can be a challenging, but achievable goal. Students who master even the smallest goal in music will be able to feel proud of their achievement.</p>

<h3>6. Kids stay engaged in school:</h3><p>An enjoyable subject like music can keep kids interested and engaged in school. Student musicians are likely to stay in school to achieve in other subjects.</p>

<h3>7. Success in society:</h3><p>Music is the fabric of our society, and music can shape abilities and character. Students in band or orchestra are less likely to abuse substances over their lifetime. Musical education can greatly contribute to children’s intellectual development as well.</p>

<h3>8. Emotional development:</h3><p>Students of music can be more emotionally developed, with empathy towards other cultures They also tend to have higher self esteem and are better at coping with anxiety.</p>

<h3>9. Students learn pattern recognition:</h3><p>Children can develop their math and pattern-recognition skills with the help of musical education. Playing music offers repetition in a fun format.</p>

<h3>10. Fine-tuned auditory skills:</h3><p>Musicians can better detect meaningful, information-bearing elements in sounds, like the emotional meaning in a baby’s cry. Students who practice music can have better auditory attention, and pick out predictable patterns from surrounding noise.</p>
